# rtop

A lightweight terminal system monitor for Linux terminals, built with Ratatui and Crossterm. rtop provides a dashboard view of CPU, memory, and basic GPU info, a simple "top/htop" style process pane, a Services (SystemD) tab, a recursive Logs browser, a Journal tab, and an embedded Shell for quick commands.

Press F1 in the app to see a concise Help popup.

## Features
- TUI dashboard with CPU load gauges and memory usage
- Applications frame showing Apache2, Nginx, Postgresql, Mysql, Podman, Docker (Installed/Active)
- Basic GPU detection (best-effort via /sys/class/drm and optional NVIDIA proc info)
- Top tabs for quick navigation:
  - Dashboard (F2)
  - top/htop (F3) with scrollable process table and details popup (Enter)
  - Services (SystemD) (F4) with scrollable table and per-row status color; details popup (Enter)
  - Logs (F5) recursively lists /var/log with Enter-to-open; prompts for sudo password on permission denied (excludes /var/log/journal)
  - Journal (F6) lists /var/log/journal files; Enter displays entries via journalctl; prompts for sudo on permission denied
  - Shell (F12) embedded PTY shell
- Keyboard-driven navigation; runs in a standard terminal

## Installation
You need Rust (cargo) installed. On Linux, run:

```
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/rtop`.

## Usage
Run the executable in your terminal:

```
./target/release/rtop
```

Press F1 at any time to bring up in-app help.

### Controls (summary)
- Switch top tabs: Left/Right, h/l, Tab/BackTab, or 1/2/3/4/5/6
- In tables (Processes/Services/Logs/Journal): Home/End jump to first/last; PgUp/PgDn move selection by 10
- In Log/Journal popups: Up/Down/Left/Right scroll by 1 line, PgUp/PgDn by a page, Home/End to top/bottom; Esc or Enter to close
- Direct tab shortcuts: F2 (Dashboard), F3 (top/htop), F4 (Services), F5 (Logs), F6 (Journal), F12 (Shell)
- Context actions: Enter on Services/Processes/Logs/Journal tables opens a details/content popup; Esc or Enter closes popups
- Exit: F10, or press `q`

Note: F12 opens an embedded shell (PTY) inside the Shell tab. While on the Shell tab, most keys are forwarded to your shell. Ctrl-C is sent to the shell (it will not quit rtop). Use F10 to exit the app. Vim-style `h`/`l` navigation is disabled while in shell so you can type normally.

## Shell
Press F12 to switch to the Shell tab and use your system shell embedded within rtop. When you leave the Shell tab or exit the shell process, youâ€™ll return to the rest of rtop. If the shell exits, press F12 again to start a new session.

## Platform support
rtop targets Linux. Some features (like GPU detection/temperature) are best-effort and depend on available sysfs/proc files and drivers.
